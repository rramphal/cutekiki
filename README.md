### Description

This site was completed for Phase 0, Unit 3, Week 7 of [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com). It is the project for the [Build a Simple Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-simple-website) course on [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/). Our assignment was to take the "Smells Like Bakin'" site and personalize it. I didn't actually build the site — I just downloaded the pre-built site and customized it. Honestly, this wasn't the most rewarding project, but I kept it as a tribute to my cute Kiki.
